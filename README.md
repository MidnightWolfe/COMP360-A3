Kaiya: Initial setup of object (rigidbody) hierarchy, joints, and scene. Applied impulse, force, and torque to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Made documentation, github repo. Debugged / tested movement and collision of objects. Added comments for clarity.

Jannine:

Markus: Used physics calculations for updating position of masses. Inspiration from https://github.com/Ryan-Mirch/Line-and-Sphere-Drawing for physical calculations.
