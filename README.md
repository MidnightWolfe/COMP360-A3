Kaiya: Initial setup of object (rigidbody) hierarchy, joints, and scene. Applied impulse, force, and torque to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Made documentation, github repo. Debugged / tested movement and collision of objects. Added comments for clarity.

Jannine: Initally applied force to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Added inital spheres to connect the object together and inital colouring to make them more interesting.

Markus: Used physics calculations for updating position of masses. Inspiration from https://github.com/Ryan-Mirch/Line-and-Sphere-Drawing for physical calculations. Added trail to follow the path of the second pendulum. Added camera movement to orbit the pendulum. Debugged movement of pendulum, and fixed the motion of it moving in the z-axis.

Ryan: Worked off of Markus' code to add the z axis rotation. Did a fair bit of YouTube watching from this video: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/tw9pjc/animation_of_the_3d_double_pendulum_solved_and/ and realized I could get something kind of cool looking if I just removed gravity from the equation. Also worked on updating everything that was in 2d to 3d by adding the appropriate (I think) variables.

Liam: Created a double pendulum from basic godot objects without hard coding, tho not as nice as markus's.
