# COMP360-A3

Kaiya: Initial setup of object (rigidbody) hierarchy, joints, and scene. Applied impulse, force, and torque to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Made documentation, github repo. Debugged / tested movement and collision of objects. Added comments for clarity.

Jannine: Initally applied force to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Added inital spheres to connect the object together and inital colouring to make them more interesting.

Markus: Used physics calculations for updating position of masses. Inspiration from https://github.com/Ryan-Mirch/Line-and-Sphere-Drawing for physical calculations.

Ryan:

Liam: Created a double pendulum from basic godot objects without hard coding, tho not as nice as markus's.
