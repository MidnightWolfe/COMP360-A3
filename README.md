Kaiya: Initial setup of object (rigidbody) hierarchy, joints, and scene. Applied impulse, force, and torque to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Made documentation, github repo. Debugged / tested movement and collision of objects. Added comments for clarity.

Jannine: Initally applied force to rigidbody objects to make it move (to some degree) with physics_process. Added inital spheres to connect the object together and inital colouring to make them more interesting.

Markus: Used physics calculations for updating position of masses. Inspiration from https://github.com/Ryan-Mirch/Line-and-Sphere-Drawing for physical calculations.

Ryan: Worked off of Markus' code to add the extra axis. Did a fair bit of YouTube watching from this video: https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/tw9pjc/animation_of_the_3d_double_pendulum_solved_and/ and realized I could get something kind of cool looking if I just removed gravity from the equation. I feel it lacks from a pure physics perspective but it's definitely swinging around. Also worked on updating everything that was in 2d to 3d by adding the appropriate (I think) variables. Also added some camera controls I used in A2, it lets you fly around with mouse and wasd to get a better idea of the 3d nature of the pendulum. Honestly, it reminds me of a Minecraft fishing rod with drawing the 2d line between the points and having one's brain fill in the 3d imagination.

Liam: Created a double pendulum from basic godot objects without hard coding, tho not as nice as markus's.
